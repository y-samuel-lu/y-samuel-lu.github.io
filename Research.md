I am interested in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology. I mainly use high-resolution supercomputer simulations to study the gas in the universe, including the structure they formed and their dynamics. I am currently in the collaboration of the [FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)](https://fire.northwestern.edu) project, which uses the [GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html#snaps-reading) code. I also used [AREPO](https://arepo-code.org) and [Athena++](https://arepo-code.org) before.

Other than astrophysics, I am also broadly interested in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, high performance computing, and mathematics.

# Intergalactic filaments
Intergalactic filaments are probably the most prominent large scale strcuture in the univerise. They were formed within the cosmic sheet (pancake) due to instabilities and host almost all the galactic haloes that contain galaxies. Moreover, at the junctions of different filaments, more massive haloes are formed, and the inner part of filaments (the "cold stream") penetrates through the virial shock surrounding the halo, which has been thought to be the main mode fusing galaxy formation.
