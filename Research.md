I am interested in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology. I mainly use high-resolution supercomputer simulations to study the gas in the universe, including the structure they formed and their dynamics. I am currently in the collaboration of the [FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)](https://fire.northwestern.edu) project, which uses the [GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html#snaps-reading) code. I also used [AREPO](https://arepo-code.org) and [Athena++](https://arepo-code.org) before.
