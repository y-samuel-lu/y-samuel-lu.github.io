I am interested in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology. I mainly use high-resolution supercomputer simulations to study the gas in the universe, including the structure they formed and their dynamics. I am currently in the collaboration of the [FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)](https://fire.northwestern.edu) project, which uses the [GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html#snaps-reading) code. I also used [AREPO](https://arepo-code.org) and [Athena++](https://arepo-code.org) before.

Other than astrophysics, I am also broadly interested in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, high performance computing, and mathematics.

# Intergalactic filaments
Intergalactic filaments are probably the most prominent large scale strcuture in the univerise. They were formed within the cosmic sheet (pancake) due to instabilities and host almost all the galactic haloes that contain galaxies. Moreover, at the junctions of different filaments, more massive haloes are formed, and the inner part of filaments (the "cold stream") penetrates through the virial shock surrounding the halo, which has been thought to be the main mode fusing galaxy formation.

# Cosmic ray (CR) transports
Cosmic rays (CR) are high energy particle beams propogating in the universe (most of which are protons) and thought to be (majorly) accelerated by the shock generated by supernova explosions. Cosmic rays have tremendous impacts on the structure and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas, and how it transports energy is still a mystery nowadays. There is no state-of-the-art model for CR transport even with the help of advanced simulations, and the properties of the ISM and CGM gas are very sensitive to different models. Identifying models that produce observables that match with observational results and make physical senses is critical on the development of CR theory.

# Accretion disks around supermassive black holes
Accretion phenomena are ubiquitous in the universe, especially around massive astrophysical objects like supermassive black holes (SMBH). They are gemetrically thin disks that carry huge angular momentum and energy. Due to the existence of magnetic fields, various instabilities exist within the disks, and the most famous one is of course the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Understanding the physics of accretion disk requires lots of knowledge of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and radiative processes, and the use of supercomputer simulations is also crucial.
