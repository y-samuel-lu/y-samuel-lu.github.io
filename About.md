I am currently a Ph. D candidate in the [Physics Department](https://physics.ucsd.edu) of the University of California, San Diego. I am doing research in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A) Department](https://astro.ucsd.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Dusan Keres](https://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/faculty:Dkeres). I am in the large [FIRE](https://fire.northwestern.edu) (Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulation project, working on galaxy evolution simulations with a focus on resolving the circumgalactic medium (CGM). I got my double bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics (with an astronomy minor) from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2022, where I worked with [Prof. S. Peng Oh](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/people/s-peng-oh) and [Prof. Omer Blaes](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/people/omer-blaes). I have also been collaborating with [Prof. Nir Mandelker](https://www.nirmandelker.com/research) on various problems regarding cold streams and filaments.

Other than physics, I am a cinephile who watches tons of movies, both going to theatres and at home. I also enjoy traditional Chinese music, and I have been playing Dizi (the Chinese bamboo flute) since I was in elementary school. Some video recordings of a concert held by the ensemble I attended when I was an undergrad at UC Santa Barbara can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJVN7N-xiM4&list=PLhcVyqe7ECtu_dCO77XwKEoSWWxtd8VIY).
