My name is Samuel Lu. I am currently a Ph. D student in the [Physics Department](https://physics.ucsd.edu) of the University of California San Diego. I am doing research in the [Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences (CASS)](https://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/Main_Page) and the [Astronomy Department](https://astro.ucsd.edu). I got my double bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics (with an astronomy minor) from UC Santa Barbara in 2022.
