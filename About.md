title: "About Me"
---

My name is Samuel Lu, and I am currently a Ph. D student in the [Physics Department](https://physics.ucsd.edu) of the University of California San Diego. I am doing research in the [Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences (CASS)](https://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/Main_Page) and the [Astronomy Department](https://astro.ucsd.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Dusan Keres](https://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/faculty:Dkeres). I got my double bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics (with an astronomy minor) from UC Santa Barbara in 2022.

Other than physics, I am a cinephile who watches tons of movies, both going to theatres and at home. I also enjoy traditional Chinese music, and I have been playing Dizi (the Chinese bamboo flute) since I was in elementary school. Some video recordings of a concert held by the ensemble I attended when I was an undergrad at UC Santa Barbara can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJVN7N-xiM4&list=PLhcVyqe7ECtu_dCO77XwKEoSWWxtd8VIY).
