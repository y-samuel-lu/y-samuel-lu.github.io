Here are some of the notes I wrote. Note that I do not claim authorship to any of them, since they are simply assimilation and reproduction of knowledge I learned from people who have much more wit than me.

# Physics notes
- A set of notes on the physics of stellar and galactic systems (since this is close to my area of research). I found that (very unfortunately) college physics courses usually fail on doing a good job teaching those topics systematically, so I think they might be useful for people who are interested in this area:

  - Part I: [Potential theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14RnAgMFF4bk6dWkm3pk6_giGrteRMLCg/view?usp=sharing)
  
  - Part II: [Orbit theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TmByovEkhnkvcINHMdh86P4KFgPxAJ5I/view?usp=sharing)
 
  - Part III: [Hydrodynamics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_F20raq_g8c2AtkeQ33kSzVUZHIUH4H/view?usp=sharing)
 

# Mathematics notes
- A note on the properties and related theorems of the Dirichlet series and Dirichlet-L function. Some knowledge on complex analysis is needed to read [this note](Dirichlet_Series.pdf).
