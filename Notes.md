Here are some of the notes I wrote. Note that I do not claim authorship to any of them, since they are simply assimilation and reproduction of knowledge I learned from people who have much more wit than me.

# Physics notes
A set of notes on the physics of stellar and galactic systems (since this is closed to my area of research). I found that (very unfortunately) college physics courses usually didn't do a good job teaching those topics systematically, so I think they might be useful for people who are interested in this area:
- Part I: [Potential theory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aQebMJs1NDjuLZR_yGZQdLIT6N_AG58_)
- Part II: [Orbit theory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aQebMJs1NDjuLZR_yGZQdLIT6N_AG58_)
- Part III: [Hydrodynamics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aQebMJs1NDjuLZR_yGZQdLIT6N_AG58_)

- # Mathematics notes
