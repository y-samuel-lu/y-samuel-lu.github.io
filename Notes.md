Here are some of the notes I wrote. I do not claim authorship to any of them, since they are simply assimilation and reproduction of knowledge I learned from people who have much more wit than me.

# Physics notes
A set of notes on the physics of stellar and galactic systems (since this is closed to my area of research). I found that very unfortunately college physics courses usually didn't do a good job teaching those topics systematically, so I think they might be useful for people who are interested in this area:
- Part I: [Potential theory](potential.pdf)
- Part II: [Orbit theory](oirbits.pdf)
- Part III: [Hydrodynamics 1](hydrodynamics 1.pdf) & [2](hydrodynamics 2.pdf)

- # Mathematics notes
