title: "Academic Notes"
---
Here are some expository notes I have written on various topics. Note that I DO NOT claim authorship to any of them, since they are simply assimilation and reproduction of knowledge I learned from people who have much more wit than me. Should there be any mistakes appearing in these notes, please let me know and I'll be happy to correct them!

# Physics notes
- A set of notes on the physics of stellar and galactic systems (since this is close to my area of research). They are hand written on iPad to be (hopefully) more illustrative. I personally found (very unfortunately) that college physics courses for physics majors usually failed on doing a good job teaching those topics systematically, so I think they might be useful for people who are interested in this area. This set of notes is under construction as I'm still learning in this area.

  - Part I: [Potential theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14liZ8i76a3QtkXxcXnwXcB85JuJN1cRw/view?usp=sharing) (updated)
  
  - Part II: [Orbit theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gSgvAh-hh9jX-_06ZJLBxsUGPoEzMXtO/view?usp=sharing) (updated)
 
  - Part III: [Hydrodynamics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_F20raq_g8c2AtkeQ33kSzVUZHIUH4H/view?usp=sharing)
    
  - Part IV: [Basic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mz15vRx_fqAVgY_l0PEWFLihvfiiDVGt/view?usp=drivesdk)
 
  - Part V: [Statistical Mechanics (in the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck language)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tJspEbOU74u5Q1eudlkbAxmJ7sUsTJuA/view?usp=sharing)

  - Part VI: [Radiation and Radiative Transfer (with additional discussion of Comptonization at the end)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-9VFxnc6Na5j7_JemFyphTvmNZjGs8Rn/view?usp=sharing)
 

# Mathematics notes
- A note on the properties and related theorems of the Dirichlet series and Dirichlet-L function. Some knowledge on complex analysis is needed to read [this note](Dirichlet_Series-2.pdf).
